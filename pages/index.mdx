# Running the API Locally

### Setting up a Virtual Environment

The commands below might look a bit different for Windows

`python3 -m venv env`

`source env/bin/activate`

You should now see (env) in your terminal. If you do, run
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
Test if requirements are installed by running `python3 main.py`

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If you are running into errors installing pyscopg2 during the pip install, Try
  ``` brew install postgresql ``` and then ```brew services start postgresql```
</Callout>

### Setting up a Local Postgres Database

1. Download PgAdmin
2. Go into Servers and right click PostgreSQL 14
3. Create Database

### Creating Database Columns

Inside main.py, change the following line:

```python
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = os.getenv("POSTGRES_URI")
```

into

```python
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = 'postgresql://postgres:<password_of_database>@localhost/<name_of_database>'
```

You can also change

```python
app.run(debug=False)
```

into

```python
app.run(debug=True)
```

In your terminal, run `python3`

When the Python REPL is opened, run the following lines: **(these lines should be run everytime you make a change to the fields of a model)**

```python
from extensions import db
from main import app
with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()
```

<Callout>
  Verify that the database columns are working properly with Postman. Try
  creating a new user and making a new post.
